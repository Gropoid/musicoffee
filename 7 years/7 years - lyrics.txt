[Chorus]
Once I was seven years old, my mama told me
"Go make yourself some friends, or you'll be lonely"
Once, I was seven years old

[Verse]
It was a big, big world, but we thought we were bigger
Pushin' each other to the limits, we were learnin' quicker
By 11, smokin' herb and drinkin', burnin' liquor
Never rich, so we were out to make that steady figure

[Chorus]
Once I was 11 years old, my daddy told me
"Go get yourself a wife, or you'll be lonely"
Once, I was 11 years old

[Verse]
I always had that dream like my daddy before me
So I started writin' songs, I started writin' stories
Somethin' about that glory just always seemed to bore me
'Cause only those I really love will ever really know me

[Chorus]
Once I was 20 years old, my story got told
Before the mornin' sun, when life was lonely
Once, I was 20 years old
(Lukas Graham!)

[Verse]
I only see my goals, I don't believe in failure
'Cause I know the smallest voices, they can make it major
I got my boys with me, at least those in favor
And if we don't meet before I leave, I hope I'll see you later

[Chorus]
Once I was 20 years old, my story got told
I was writin' 'bout everything I saw before me
Once, I was 20 years old

[Chorus]
Soon, we'll be 30 years old, our songs have been sold
We've traveled around the world, and we're still roamin'
Soon, we'll be 30 years old

[Verse]
I'm still learnin' about life, my woman brought children for me
So I can sing them all my songs, and I can tell them stories
Most of my boys are with me, some are still out seeking glory
And some I had to leave behind, my brother, I'm still sorry

[Bridge]
Soon, I'll be 60 years old, my daddy got 61
Remember life and then your life becomes a better one
I made a man so happy when I wrote a letter once
I hope my children come and visit once or twice a month

Soon, I'll be 60 years old, will I think the world is cold?
Or will I have a lot of children who can warm me?
Soon, I'll be 60 years old

[Chorus]
Soon, I'll be 60 years old, will I think the world is cold?
Or will I have a lot of children who can warm me?
Soon, I'll be 60 years old

[Chorus]
Once I was seven years old, my mama told me
"Go make yourself some friends, or you'll be lonely"
Once, I was seven years old

Once, I was seven years old
