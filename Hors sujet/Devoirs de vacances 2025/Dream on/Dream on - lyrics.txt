[Verse 1]
Every time that I look in the mirror
All these lines on my face gettin' clearer
            The past is gone
It went by like dusk to dawn

[Pre-Chorus]
Isn't that the way?
Everybody's got their dues in life to pay, yeah

[Chorus 1]
I know nobody knows
Where it comes and where it goes
I know it's everybody's sin
You got to lose to know how to win

[Intermède 1]

[Verse 2]
Half my life's in books' written pages
Live and learn from fools and from sages
           You know it's true
All the things come back to you

[Chorus 2]
Sing with me, sing for the year
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear
Sing it with me, if it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away

[Intermède 2]

[Chorus 3]
Yeah, sing with me, sing for the year
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear
Sing it with me , if it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away

[Bridge]
Dream on, dream on
Dream on, dream until them dreams come true
Dream on, dream on
Dream on, dream until your dreams come true
Dream on, dream on
Dream on, dream on
Dream on, dream on
Dream on, ah

[Chorus 4]
Sing with me, sing for the year
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear
Sing it with me, if it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away

[Chorus 5]
Sing with me, sing for the year
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear
Sing it with me, if it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away
