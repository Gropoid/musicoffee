[Couplet]
You never had it easy, I know
But I still remember you
And what we used to say, so
I say, this is my song for you, my friend
You can only see that I
Can hardly let things go, no oh, oh yeah

So, listen to the sound of my voice
Your brothers sending all my love
It's givin' me no choice, no, no, no
Listen to the sound of my voice

[Refrain]
Raggamuffin is a freedom fighter
He's handling a choice and I know that
Dear raggamuffin is one of the friends
What you see is what you really need in the end
What you ever gonna do I don't know
And Dear raggamuffin shall I knock for the dawn
'Cause she has the wisdom of a not fool around
What-a is a good sense see under ya ground, yeah

[Couplet]
You never had it easy, I know
But I still remember you
And what we had so
I said this my song for you, my friend
You could only see that I
Will never forget, yeah, yeah, so

Ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah

[Refrain]
Say dear raggamuffin is one of the friend
What you see is what you really did in the end
But what you ever gonna gonna do, I don't know
And dear raggamuffin shall not fall down
'Cause she has the wisdom of a not fool around
But why don't you leave good sense on the ground, yes

[Outro]
