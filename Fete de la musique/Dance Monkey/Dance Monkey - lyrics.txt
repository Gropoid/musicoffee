[Verse]
They say, oh my God I see the way you shine
Take your hand, my dear, and place them both in mine
You know you stopped me dead while I was passing by
And now I beg to see you dance just one more time

Ooh, I see you, see you, see you every time
And oh my I, I, I like your style
You, you make me, make me, make me wanna cry
And now I beg to see you dance just one more time

     So they say
[Chorus]
"Dance for me, dance for me, dance for me, oh-oh
I've never seen anybody do the things you do before"
They say, "Move for me, move for me, move for me, ay-ay
And when you're done, I'll make you do it all again"

[Verse]
I said, "Oh my God I see you walking by
Take my hands, my dear, and look me in my eyes"
Just like a monkey, I've been dancing my whole life
But you just beg to see me dance just one more time

Ooh, I see you, see you, see you every time
And oh my I, I, I like your style
You, you make me, make me, make me wanna cry
And now I beg to see you dance just one more time

     So they say
[Chorus]
"Dance for me, dance for me, dance for me, oh-oh
I've never seen anybody do the things you do before"
They say, "Move for me, move for me, move for me, ay-ay
And when you're done, I'll make you do it all again"

     They say
[Chorus]
"Dance for me, dance for me, dance for me, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
I've never seen anybody do the things you do before"
They say, "Move for me, move for me, move for me, ay-ay
And when you're done, I'll make you do it all again"

[Bridge]
Ooh
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, oh
Ooh
Ah, ah, ah

     They say
[Chorus]
"Dance for me, dance for me, dance for me, oh-oh
I've never seen anybody do the things you do before
They say, "Move for me, move for me, move for me, ay-ay
And when you're done, I'll make you do it all again"

     They say
[Chorus]
"Dance for me, dance for me, dance for me, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
I've never seen anybody do the things you do before"
They say, "Move for me, move for me, move for me, ay-ay
And when you're done, I'll make you do it all again
All again"
