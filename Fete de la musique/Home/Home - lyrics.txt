[Verse]
Alabama, Arkansas, I do love my ma and pa, Not the way that I do love you
Holy moley, me oh my, You're the apple of my eye, Girl, I've never loved one like you
Man, oh man, you're my best friend, I scream it to the nothingness, There ain't nothing that I need
Well, hot and heavy, pumpkin pie, Chocolate candy, Jesus Christ, Ain't nothing please me more than you

[Chorus]
Ah, home, let me go home, Home is wherever I'm with you (x2)

[Bridge]
La, la, la, la, take me home
Mommy, I'm coming home

[piou piou]
[Verse]
I'll follow you into the park, Through the jungle, through the dark, Girl, I never loved one like you
Moats and boats and waterfalls, Alleyways and pay phone calls, I've been everywhere with you (That's true)
Laugh until we think we'll die, Barefoot on a summer night, Never could be sweeter than with you
And in the streets you run a-free, Like it's only you and me, Geez, you're something to see

[Chorus]
Ah, home, let me go home, Home is wherever I'm with you (x2)

[Chorus]
La, la, la, la, take me home
Daddy, I'm coming home

[Verse]
Jade? -Alexander - Do you remember that day you fell out of my window? I sure do, you came jumping out after me
Well, you fell on the concrete, nearly broke your ass
 And you were bleeding all over the place and I Rushed you out to the hospital, you remember that?
          Yes, I do

Well there's something I never told you about that night, -What didn't you tell me?
  While you were sitting in the backseat smoking a cigarette you thought was going to be your last

I was falling deep, deeply in love with you, And I never told you until just now

[Chorus]
Ah, home, let me go home
Home is wherever I'm with you
Ah, home, let me go home
Home is where I'm alone with you

Home, let me come home
Home is wherever I'm with you
Ah, home, yes I am home
Home is when I'm alone with you

Alabama, Arkansas
I do love my ma and pa
Moats and boats and waterfalls
Alleyways and pay phone calls

Ah, home, let me go home
Home is wherever I'm with you
Ah, home, let me go home
Home is where I'm alone with you
