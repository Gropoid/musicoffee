[Intro]

[Verse x2]
When you were here before
Couldn't look you in the eye
You're just like an angel
Your skin makes me cry
You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
I wish I was special
You're so fuckin' special

[Chorus]
But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here? I don't belong here

[Verse x2]
I don't care if it hurts
I wanna have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not around
You're so fuckin' special
I wish I was special

[Chorus]
But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here? I don't belong here, oh, oh

[Mont√©e en sextolets]
She's running out again, oh
She's running out
She run, run, run, run
Run

[Verse]
Whatever makes you happy, Whatever you want
You're so fuckin' special, I wish I was special

[Chorus]
But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here? I don't belong here
I don't belong here
