You never had it easy, I know
But I still remember you
And what we used to say, so
I say, this is my song for you, my friend

You can only see that I
Can hardly let things go, no oh, oh yeah
So, listen to the sound of my voice
Your brothers sending all my love
It's givin' me no choice, no, no, no
Listen to the sound of my voice

He's handling a choice and I know that
