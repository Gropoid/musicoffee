[Couplet]
You never had it easy, I know
But I still remember you
And what we used to say so
I say, this my song for you my friend
You can only see that I
Can hardly let things go, no, oh, yea

So listen to the sound of mi voice
Yo brother send him all my love
He's given me no choice, no, no, no
Listen to the sound and the voice, huh
Raggamuffin is a freedom fighter
He's handling a choice and I know that

[Refrain]
Dear raggamuffin is one of the friend
What you see is what you really did in the end
But what you ever gonna, gonna do, I don't know
And dear raggamuffin shall not fall down
'Cause he has the wisdom of a not fool around
But why don't you leave good sense on the ground, yes

[Couplet]
You never had it easy, I know
But I still remember you
And what we used to have so
I say, this my song for you my friend
You can only see that I
Will never forget ye-yes so

Ooh wow wow, yeah
Ooh wow wow, yeah yeah
Ooh wow wow, yeah
Ooh wow wow, yeah yeah

[Refrain]
Say dear raggamuffin is one of the friend
What you see is what you really did in the end
But what you ever gonna gonna do, I don't know
And dear raggamuffin shall not fall down
'Cause he has the wisdom of a not fool around
But why don't you leave good sense on the ground, yes

[Outro]
