[Intro]
Ba-ba-da-ba, da-ba-da-ba
Ba-ba-da-ba, da-ba-da-ba
Ba-ba-da-ba, da-ba-da-ba
Ba-ba-ba-ba

[Verse 1]
I think about that day
I left him at a Greyhound station
West of Santa FÃ©
We were seventeen, but he was sweet and it was true
Still I did what I had to do
'Cause I just knew
Summer Sunday nights
We'd sink into our seats
Right as they dimmed out all the lights
A Technicolor world made out of music and machine
It called me to be on that screen
And live inside each scene

[Pre-Chorus]
Without a nickel to my name
Hopped a bus, here I came
Could be brave or just insane
We'll have to see
'Cause maybe in that sleepy town
He'll sit one day, the lights are down
He'll see my face and think of how
He used to know me

[Chorus]
Climb these hills
I'm reaching for the heights
And chasing all the lights that shine (lights that shine)
And when they let you down (it's another day of)
You'll get up off the ground (it's another day of)
'Cause morning rolls around
And it's another day of sun

[Verse 2]
I hear 'em every day
The rhythms in the canyons
That'll never fade away
The ballads in the barrooms
Left by those who came before
They say "you gotta want it more"
So I bang on every door

[Pre-Chorus]
And even when the answer's "no"
Or when my money's running low
The dusty mic and neon glow
Are all I need
And someday as I sing my song
A small-town kid'll come along
That'll be the thing to push him on and go, go

[Chorus]
Climb these hills, I'm reaching for the heights
And chasing all the lights that shine (lights that shine)
And when they let you down (it's another day of)
You'll get up off the ground (it's another day of)
'Cause morning rolls around
And it's another day of sun
And when they let you down
The morning rolls around


It's another day of sun (oh)
It's another day of sun (oh)
It's another day of sun (sun, sun, sun, sun)
It's just another day of sun (oh)
Just another day of sun (oh)
It's another day of sun (sun)
Another day has just begun (oh)
It's another day of sun
It's another day of sun
