[Verse]
Tell me something, girl
Are you happy in this modern world?
Or do you need more?
Is there somethin' else you're searching for?
I'm falling
In all the good times I find myself
Longin' for change
And in the bad times I fear myself

[Instru ?]

[Verse]
Tell me something, boy
Aren't you tired tryin' to fill that void?
Or do you need more?
Ain't it hard keeping it so hardcore?
I'm falling
In all the good times I find myself
Longing for a change
And in the bad times I fear myself

[Chorus]
I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in
I'll never meet the ground
Crash through the surface, where they can't hurt us
We're far from the shallow now
In the sha-ha, sha-hallow
In the sha-ha, sha-la-la-la-low
In the sha-ha, sha-hallow
We're far from the shallow now

[Bridge]
Oh hohohohoho
Oh hohohohoho wohoo
Oh hohohohohoooooo

[Chorus]
I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in
I'll never meet the ground
Crash through the surface, where they can't hurt us
We're far from the shallow now
In the sha-ha, shallow
In the sha-ha, sha-la-la-la-low
In the sha-ha, shallow
We're far from the shallow now
