I've seen it last for thirty years
Seen it bloom and end in tears
I've seen it after school and in the park
Sat right across me on the tube
Seen it miss a stop or two
Seen it trying not to fall apart

I've heard it laced in every song
And still the words all come out wrong
It doesn't always answer when you call
Brings out the worst, brings out the best
I understand it less and less
I guess I'm not supposed to know it all

I've seen it dance with friends around the table
In Eleanor, Rosie and Louise
And it makes me cry to think that I am able
To give it back the way it gives to me

I've seen it grow old and forget
Until it's just a silhouette
'Til someone picks it up and sends it on
I've seen the films, I've read the books
My mum and dad, they got me hooked
The fairy tale, the search goes on and on

The more you look, the more you find
It's all around you all the time
Catches your eye, you blink and then it's gone
Brings out the worst, brings out the best
I know it's somewhere in my chest
I guess it's been inside me all along
