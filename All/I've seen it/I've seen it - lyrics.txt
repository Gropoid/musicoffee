[Verse]
I've seen it last for thirty years
Seen it bloom and end in tears
I've seen it after school and in the park
[Verse]
Sat right across me on the tube
Seen it miss a stop or two
Seen it trying not to fall apart

[Hook]
I've heard it laced in every song
And still the words all come out wrong
It doesn't always answer when you call
[Verse]
Brings out the worst, brings out the best
I understand it less and less
I guess I'm not supposed to know it all

[Chorus]
I've seen it dance with friends around the table
In Eleanor, Rosie and Louise
And it makes me cry to think that I am able
To give it back the way it gives to me

[Verse]
I've seen it grow old and forget
Until it's just a silhouette
'Til someone picks it up and sends it on
[Verse]
I've seen the films, I've read the books
My mum and dad, they got me hooked
The fairy tale, the search goes on and on

[Hook]
The more you look, the more you find
It's all around you all the time
Catches your eye, you blink and then it's gone
[Verse]
Brings out the worst, brings out the best
I know it's somewhere in my chest
I guess it's been inside me all along
