[Verse]
Why
Can't you decide
You're going home to her
At the end of the day
This can't be right
No

Say
What you have to say now
Don't keep me on the line
With my heart on a plate
While you're away

[Chorus]
So could you do me a favor
Forget to call my name
When you're in pain
If you can't love me better
Because for you I know I'd

[Hook]
fall again
Oh Oh
Fall again
Oh Oh
All in

[Instru]
[Verse]
Lie
Kiss me goodbye
Pretend you didn't know
It would come to an end
Just one more night honey

(It's a )shame
Let's cut to the chase
Now!
I'm flattered by your ploys
Trying to keep me around
A little obvious

[Chorus]
So could you do me a favor
Forget to call my name
When you're in pain
Since you can't love me better
Because for you I know I'd

[Hook]x2
fall again... Oh Oh
Fall again... Oh Oh
Fall again... Oh Oh Oh
I'd fall again Oh Oh Oh
All in

[Instru]x4 ...
