[Chorus]
I will remember you
Will you remember me?
Don't let your life pass you by
Weep not for the memories

[Verse]
Remember the good times that we had?
I let them slip away from us when things got bad
How clearly I first saw you smilin' in the sun
Wanna feel your warmth upon me, I wanna be the one

[Chorus]
I will remember you
Will you remember me?
Don't let your life pass you by
Weep not for the memories

[Verse]
I'm so tired but I can't sleep
Standin' on the edge of something much too deep
It's funny how we feel so much we cannot say a word
We are screaming inside oh we can't be heard

[Chorus]
I will remember you
Will you remember me?
Don't let your life pass you by
Weep not for the memories

[Verse]
I'm so afraid to love you but more afraid to loose
Clinging to a past that doesn't let me choose
Once there was a darkness, deep and endless night
You gave me everything you had oh, you gave me light

[Chorus]
I will remember you
Will you remember me?
Don't let your life pass you by
Weep not for the memories

[Chorus]
I will remember you
Will you remember me?
Don't let your life pass you by
Weep not for the memories

Weep not for the memories
