[Verse]
Another turning point, a fork stuck in the road
Time grabs you by the wrist, directs you where to go
So make the best of this test, and don't ask why
It's not a question, but a lesson learned in time

[Chorus]
It's something unpredictable
But in the end, is right
I hope you had the time of your life

[Verse]
So take the photographs and still frames in your mind
Hang it on a shelf in good health and good time
Tattoos of memories, and dead skin on trial
For what it's worth, it was worth all the while

[Chorus]
It's something unpredictable
But in the end, is right
I hope you had the time of your life

[Instru]

[Chorus]
It's something unpredictable
But in the end, is right
I hope you had the time of your life

[Chorus]
It's something unpredictable
But in the end, is right
I hope you had the time of your life
