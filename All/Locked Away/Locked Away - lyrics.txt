[Chorus]
If I got locked away and we lost it all today
Tell me honestly, would you still love me the same? (Need 'em)
If I showed you my flaws (whirl), if I couldn't be strong (why?)
Tell me honestly, would you still love me the same?

[Verse 1]
Right about now (what?)
If a judge for life me, would you stay by my side? (Ya)
Or is you gonna say goodbye? (Bye, bye, bye)
Can you tell me right now? (Can you tell me?)
If I couldn't buy you the fancy things in life (my, my)
Shawty, would it be alright? (Right)
Come on, show me that you're down (uh-huh)

(Tell me, would you die for me? Uh)

Tell me, would you really cry for me?
(Would you really cry for me? Uh)
Baby, don't lie to me

Skiddly dong, dong, dong, dang (ah)
All I want is somebody real, who don't need much (yeah, yeah)
