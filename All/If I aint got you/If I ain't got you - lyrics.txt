[Verse 1]
Some people live for the fortune
Some people live just for the fame
Some people live for the power, yeah
Some people live just to play the game

[Pre-Chorus]
Some people think that the physical things
Define what's within
And I've been there before, but that life's a bore
So full of the superficial

[Chorus]
Some people want it all
But I don't want nothin' at all
If it ain't you, baby
If I ain't got you, baby
Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
But everything means nothin'
If I ain't got you, yeah

[Verse 2]
Some people search for a fountain
That promises forever young (Ya know)
Some people need three dozen roses
And that's the only way to prove you love them

[Pre-Chorus]
Hand me the world on a silver platter
And what good would it be?
With no one to share
With no one who truly cares for me

[Chorus]
Some people want it all
But I don't want nothin' at all
If it ain't you, baby
If I ain't got you, baby
Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
But everything means nothin'
If I ain't got you, you, you

Some people want it all
But I don't want nothin' at all
If it ain't you, baby
If I ain't got you, baby
Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
But everything means nothin'
If I ain't got you, yeah

[Outro]
If I ain't got you with me, baby
Oh, ooh
Said nothin' in this whole wide world don't mean a thing
If I ain't got you with me, baby
