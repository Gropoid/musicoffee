[Chorus 1]
(Ooh, ooh) ooh, you can dance, you can jive
Having the time of your life
Ooh-ooh, ooh, see that girl, watch that scene
Digging the dancing queen

[Verse 1]
Friday night and the lights are low
Looking out for a place to go, mm
Where they play the right music
Getting in the swing
You come to look for a king

Anybody could be that guy
Night is young and the music's high
With a bit of rock music
Everything is fine
You're in the mood for a dance
And when you get the chance

[Chorus 2]
You are the dancing queen
Young and sweet, only 17
Dancing queen
Feel the beat from the tambourine, oh, yeah
You can dance, you can jive
Having the time of your life
Ooh-ooh, ooh, see that girl, watch that scene
Digging the dancing queen

[Verse 2]
You're a tease, you turn 'em on
Leave 'em burning and then you're gone
Looking out for another, anyone will do
You're in the mood for a dance
And when you get the chance

[Chorus 3]
You are the dancing queen
Young and sweet, only 17
Dancing queen
Feel the beat from the tambourine, oh, yeah
You can dance, you can jive
Having the time of your life
Ooh-ooh, ooh, see that girl, watch that scene
Digging the dancing queen

Digging the dancing queen
