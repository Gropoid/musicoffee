[Interlude 1]
[Verse]
I'm sittin' here in a boring room
It's just another rainy Sunday afternoon
I'm wasting my time
I got nothing to do
I'm hanging around
I'm waiting for you
But nothing ever happens and I wonder

[Verse]
I'm driving around in my car
I'm driving too fast
I'm driving too far
I'd like to change my point of view
I feel so lonely
I'm waiting for you
But nothing ever happens and I wonder

[Chorus]
I wonder how
I wonder why
Yesterday you told me 'bout the blue blue sky
And all that I can see is just a yellow lemon tree
I'm turning my head up and down
I'm turning, turning, turning, turning, turning around
And all that I can see is just another lemon tree

[Interlude 2]
Sing!
Dap-dadada-dam-didap-da
Dadada-dam-didap-da
Dap-dip di-da

[Verse]
I'm sittin' here
I miss the power
I'd like to go out taking a shower
But there's a heavy cloud inside my head
I feel so tired
Put myself into bed
Well, nothing ever happens and I wonder

[Bridge]
Isolation is not good for me
Isolation, I don't want to sit on the lemon tree

[Interlude 3]
I'm stepping around in the desert of joy
Baby, anyhow I'll get another toy
And everything will happen and you wonder

[Chorus]
I wonder how
I wonder why
Yesterday you told me 'bout the blue blue sky
And all that I can see is just another lemon tree
I'm turning my head up and down
I'm turning, turning, turning, turning, turning around
And all that I can see is just a yellow lemon tree
And I wonder, wonder

[Chorus final]
I wonder how
I wonder why
Yesterday you told me 'bout the blue blue sky
And all that I can see
And all that I can see
And all that I can see
Is just a yellow lemon tree
