I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need
I don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you, yeah

I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need (and I)
Don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I don't need to hang my stocking
There upon the fireplace (I)
Santa Claus won't make me happy
With a toy on Christmas day

I just want you for my own (ooh)
More than you could ever know (ooh)
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you (you, baby)

Oh, I won't ask for much this Christmas
I won't even wish for snow (and I)
I just wanna keep on waiting
Underneath the mistletoe

I won't make a list and send it
To the North Pole for Saint Nick (I)
I won't even stay awake
To hear those magic reindeer click

'Cause I just want you here tonight (ooh)
Holding on to me so tight (ooh)
What more can I do
Oh, baby all I want for Christmas is you (you, baby)

Oh-oh, all the lights are shining
So brightly everywhere (so brightly, baby)
And the sound of children's
Laughter fills the air (oh)

And everyone is singing (oh, yeah)
I hear those sleigh bells ringing
Santa won't you bring me (yeah)
The one I really need (oh)
Won't you please bring my baby to me?

Oh, I don't want a lot for Christmas
This is all I'm asking for (I)
I just wanna see my baby
Standing right outside my door

Oh, I just want you for my own (ooh)
More than you could ever know (ooh)
Make my wish come true
Oh, baby, all I want for Christmas is you (you, baby)

All I want for Christmas is you, baby
All I want for Christmas is you, baby
All I want for Christmas is you, baby
All I want for Christmas is you, baby
All I want for Christmas is you, baby
