[Verse]
I can see clearly now the rain is gone
I can see all obstacles in my way
Gone are the dark clouds that had me blind


[Chorus] It's gonna be a bright (bright)
  Bright (bright) sunshiny day
[Chorus] It's gonna be a bright (bright)
  Bright (bright) sunshiny day

[Verse]
Oh, yes I can make it now the pain is gone
All of the bad feelings have disappeared
Here is that rainbow I've been praying for

[Chorus]It's gonna be a bright (bright)
 Bright (bright) sunshiny day

[Bridge]
Look all around, there's nothing but blue skies
Look straight ahead, there's nothing but blue skii
iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiies

[Verse]
I can see clearly now the rain is gone
I can see all obstacles in my way
Here is that rainbow I've been praying for

[Chorus]
It's gonna be a bright (bright)
Bright (bright) sunshiny day

[Chorus]
It's gonna be a bright (bright)
Bright (bright) sunshiny day

[Chorus]
Bri-ri-ri-ri', bright, (bright)
Bright (bright) sunshiny day, yeah, eh

[Chorus]
It's gonna be a bright (bright)
Bright (bright) sunshiny day

[Chorus]
It's gonna be a bright (bright)
Bright (bright) sunshiny day, yeah, na

[Chorus]
It's gonna be a bright (bright)
Bright (bright) sunshiny day

[Chorus]

Bright (bright) sunshiny day
